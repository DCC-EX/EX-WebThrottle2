## Getting started
We recommend using our hosted version of WebThrottle. However, this isn't available yet.
At the moment we recommend using the old version of WebThrottle which you can find [here](https://dcc-ex.com/WebThrottle-EX).

Once we have a sufficient number of features, we'll start publishing weekly testing builds for people to try out.
